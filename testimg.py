#to create code we need to think about what blood pressure numbers mean and normal blood pressure for different stages of age 
"""
Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers, one over the other. Both are measured in units called millimetres of mercury(mm Hg)
Systolic pressure: the top number, is the pressure each time your heart contracts (or squeezes)
Diastolic pressure: the bottom number, is the pressure in the artery as the heart relaxes before the next beat.

blood pressure    /     systolic     /     diastolic     /
  low                 less than 90        less than 60
  optimal             less than 120        less than 80
  normal                 120-129              80-84
  normal to high        130-139              85-89
  high              greater than 140     greater than 90
